# General Service Framework (GSF)

[English](README.md) | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.zh-CN.md)

GSF is a lightweight, general-purpose low-code service framework developed using Java and Spring Boot. It aims to help developers easily build maintainable and scalable server-side applications.

With the GSF framework, you can quickly accomplish the following tasks:

- Create standardized RESTful API interfaces 
- Provide services with unified CRUD operations 
- Standard Controller-Service-Repository layered architecture 
- Integrate Spring Security for authentication and authorization 
- Implement complex data queries and pagination through a filter-based mechanism 
- Handle entity data changes via a unified event mechanism 
- Global HTTP exception handling to provide user-friendly error responses

GSF is built on the following technology stack:
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- Snowflake ID
